# ESWebsite — Engineering Society, Sultan Qaboos University

Landing site for the Engineering Society, built with Next.js (App Router, TypeScript), GSAP and
React Three Fiber, in English and Arabic. Earlier drafts are kept:

- **Draft 1** (Vite): the sibling folder `../ES`, untouched.
- **Draft 2 / Draft 3** (Next.js): `drafts/draft-2-source.zip`, `drafts/draft-3-source.zip`.
- **Draft 4 onward:** this repository's git history.

Product scope comes from `PRD.pdf` (Idea & Requirements Document v1.0). This is the public
site only: no backend, authentication or admin tools.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # production build (includes type checking)
npm start          # serve the production build
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

**Testing on a phone:** run `npm run dev` and open the **Network** URL it prints (for example
`http://192.168.8.158:3000`) on a phone on the same Wi-Fi. Next.js blocks dev-only assets for
origins it doesn't know, so without `allowedDevOrigins` in `next.config.ts` the phone received
the HTML but the page never hydrated: no menu, no animations, no 3D. Private network ranges are
now allowed in development; production builds were never affected.

## Routes

- `/` — hero, society figures, overview, `#events`, `#activities`, `#projects`, `#disciplines`,
  `#leadership`, `#join` and the footer.
- `/about` — overview, the society's facts, and the full structure (`#structure`).
- `/activities` — the archive of previous activities, filterable by programme and year.

## English | العربية

The society's Arabic name is **الجماعة الهندسية** (English: Engineering Society). The college's
seven engineering societies, which the society works with, are still written الجمعيات in
Arabic; change those too if they are also جماعات.

- **Default:** English. The navbar switch (a single ع / EN toggle on smaller screens) saves the
  choice in a cookie (`es-locale`, one year) and in localStorage.
- **No reload:** switching refreshes the current route on the server, so every string, `lang`
  and `dir` change in one commit. Scroll position, open state and the hero's 3D scene stay as
  they are.
- **No flash:** because the server reads the cookie, a returning Arabic visitor receives Arabic,
  right-to-left HTML. Pages are therefore rendered per request rather than prerendered.
- **Where the words live:**
  - Interface copy: `lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.ts` and `ar.ts`. `ar.ts` is typed against `en.ts`, so
    a string that has no translation fails the build.
  - Content: the files in `content/` carry `{ en, ar }` fields next to their data.
- **In code:**
  - Server Components call `await getI18n()` (`lib/i18n/server.ts`); Client Components call
    `useI18n()`. Both return `{ t, l, locale, dir, intl }`, where `l(value)` picks the current
    language from an `{ en, ar }` field.
- **Typography:**
  - Arabic is set in IBM Plex Sans Arabic. Latin text and digits inside Arabic fall back to the
    English faces.
  - Arabic is never letter-spaced and uses taller line heights.
  - Numbers stay in Western digits.
- **RTL:**
  - Layout uses logical CSS properties. Arrows mirror.
  - Direction-dependent motion follows the page direction: schedule rows, rule draws, the
    activity photo masks and the leadership rail.

## What is real and what is a preview

| Area | State | Where to change it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Society figures (home) | **Members, Visitors, Projects, Events: demonstration values** (1,250 · 18,400 · 86 · 140), each tagged "Demo figure" with a note that they are not verified. They count up on arrival. Replace `value`, add `reportingPeriod` and `source`, and remove `demo: true`. Visitors need real analytics, not a hand-made counter. | `content/stats.ts` → `SOCIETY_STATS` |
| Society facts (About) | From the society's own overview: established 2000–01, 7 societies, 6 exhibitions and 6 gatherings (the last two qualified: reporting date unknown). | `content/stats.ts` → `SOCIETY_FACTS` |
| Overview | The society's own photograph (`public/images/overview.jpg`) under a blue atmosphere with layered parallax. | `content/overview.ts` |
| Activities | The six official activities (التجمع الهندسي، البرنامج الهندسي، ورش الخريجين، أستوديو الخريجين، الأمسيات، المسابقات), each an automatic slideshow of **demonstration events**: titles, dates and attendance are samples tagged "Demo". Each gallery opens on its own society photograph; the society's other photographs repeat after it. أستوديو الخريجين's description is still to come. Add real events to an activity's `events` without `demo`. | `content/activities.ts` |
| Archive | Empty until editions are documented. | `content/activities.ts` → `ACTIVITY_EDITIONS` |
| Leadership & structure | One President and three Vice Presidents, **all vacant**; no term, chairs or deputies. فريق التصوير is listed once (the brief listed it twice). | `content/structure.ts` |
| Events | **Sample listings**, labelled "Sample". Registration is a preview dialog; nothing is submitted. | `content/events.ts` |
| Projects | **Sample archive entries**. The discipline filter really filters them. | `content/projects.ts` |
| Disciplines | The seven disciplines from Draft 1's content, not an official SQU list. | `content/disciplines.ts` |
| Membership | No registration flow yet. "Join the Society" opens a preview dialog. | `content/site.ts` → `membershipUrl` |
| Social accounts | **No verified URLs.** Instagram and LinkedIn show in the footer, unlinked and marked "Link to come". Other platforms appear only once given a URL. | `content/social.ts` |

Social URLs are validated: https, on the platform's own domain, pointing to a profile path.

## Hero sculpture

- **The scene:** a live Three.js scene (`components/hero/emblem/`) derived from the society's
  four-part logo. The official logo file itself is never altered.
- **Desktop:** a sticky, scrubbed assembly that is fully reversible, with pointer tilt capped at
  ±4°.
- **Mobile:** a compact, lighter scene.
- **Stills:** stills in `public/hero/` cover first paint on every screen size, plus reduced
  motion, Save-Data and no-WebGL:
  - `emblem-opening.webp`: desktop.
  - `emblem-stacked.webp`: phones and tablets. Before this still existed, the phone hero was
    empty until WebGL arrived.
  - `emblem-assembled.webp`: the fallback.
- **Regenerating:** run `scripts/capture-still.mjs 0|1|2` after changing the geometry.

## Motion

- **Vocabulary:** one shared set of timings and easings in `lib/motion.ts`, mirrored in
  `styles/tokens.css`. Each section gets its own recipe rather than a repeated fade
  (`components/motion/ScrollReveals.tsx`).
- **Recipes by section:**
  - **Society figures:** icons draw in and real figures count up once.
  - **Overview:**
    - The photograph, blueprint grid, light and drawn marks sit on separate depth planes that
      move at different speeds as you scroll.
    - Points of light drift on top (`OverviewLights.tsx`, one 2D canvas). Each light has a depth:
      far lights are small and slow, near lights larger, softer and quicker. They twinkle, and
      they move at depth-dependent speeds as you scroll.
    - On fine pointers the layers lean slightly toward the cursor. Phones get the same layers
      with slightly less travel.
    - The canvas only runs while the section is on screen.
  - **Activities:**
    - Each slideshow crossfades with no blank frame, on a slow zoom. A progress line is its
      clock, so pausing freezes line, zoom and timer together.
    - The six start staggered and pause while hovered, touched, keyboard-focused or off
      screen.
    - Swipe on touch screens; arrow keys and dots on all.
    - Frames unmask on arrival and carry a light parallax (phones included) and a tilt of at
      most 2° on desktop.
  - **Touch screens:** effects that waited for hover (the discipline symbols' moving detail, the
    activity accent lines) play when the element is centred in view (`InViewMarker.tsx`).
  - **Leadership:** the President appears first, then the connectors draw, then the Vice
    Presidents.
- **Reduced motion:** everything is respected, and content is visible without JavaScript.

## Design skills

Installed at project scope in `.claude/skills` (see `skills-lock.json`): Emil Kowalski's skills,
Hallmark, and UI UX Pro Max. The stamp at the top of `styles/tokens.css` and
`.hallmark/log.json` record the design choices.
